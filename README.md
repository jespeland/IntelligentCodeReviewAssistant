# IntelligentCodeReviewAssistant

Author: Jakob Espeland

This project implements a GitHub webhook that is POSTing commit metadata to a flask app server. In later development stages, the Claude api will be linked in order to create an intelegent code review assistant. 

This project runs on a virtual Python 3.11.0 environment.
